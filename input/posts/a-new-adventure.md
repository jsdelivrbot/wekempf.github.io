# A New Adventure

I've been a .NET developer and blogger for over a decade, and while I'm not giving up on .NET in my spare time, I've taken a new position where I'm now a Clojure developer. While I'm still likely to blog about .NET from time to time, you can expect I'll now blog more often about Clojure. I hope you still find me interesting.
